# XMeme Project

XMeme is a project that aims to provide a platform for sharing and discovering memes. It is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot and MongoDB that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete memes. The application is designed to be simple, easy to use, and scalable.

Users can submit new memes by providing a URL to an image, a caption, and their username. Each meme is given a unique ID and timestamp and is stored in a MongoDB database. Users can view a list of the most recent memes, the most trending memes, search for memes by text, and view the details of a specific meme.

XMeme also includes features for managing memes, such as updating the caption or URL of an existing meme, deleting a meme, and adding comments to a meme. The application provides RESTful endpoints for each of these features, as well as error handling and validation to ensure that only valid data is submitted.

Overall, XMeme is a fun and engaging project that showcases the capabilities of Spring Boot and MongoDB for building web applications.
